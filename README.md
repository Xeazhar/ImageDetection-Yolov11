# üß† Road Damage Classification using Deep Learning

This repository contains all necessary resources for training, evaluating, and visualizing a deep learning model for road damage classification. The pipeline includes data preprocessing, augmentation, model training/testing, evaluation, and result analysis.




## üîç Project Overview

Sure! Here's a concise and professional introductory paragraph for your project description:

---

This project focuses on the development of a deep learning-based road damage classification system using Python. It includes a complete pipeline‚Äîfrom data preparation and augmentation to model training, testing, and evaluation‚Äîimplemented through Python scripts and Jupyter notebooks. The repository contains labeled datasets, trained models, training history logs, and visual outputs such as confusion matrices and performance graphs. The goal is to accurately detect and classify various types of road damage to support infrastructure monitoring and maintenance efforts.
